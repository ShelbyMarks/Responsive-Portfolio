      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQEBEFKvyOmv0A/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0?e=1549497600&v=beta&t=rf58-ZIyfBe0pXeZ_e45pbHV2C272ScIdN-5WxEJl7o" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Strategic thinker, capable of large-scale project analytics and management. Proven team player successful at building relationships. Proficient in analytics, research, project management, event planning, community outreach, and written and verbal communication including political and subjective analysis, blogging, social networking, policy writing, and public speaking.</p>

      <p>After graduating from Drake University, I was hired as a Network Real Estate Specialist with the intention of interpreting legal code and researching non-established small cell permitting processes. After several weeks of proven expedient research and analysis, I was transitioned to a de-facto Quality Assurance Lead Role. Subsequently, I established myself as the subject-matter-expert for validating data misalignment, finding areas for development in the database, creating executive summaries, and project managing activities that were detrimental to the business. </p>

      <p>I further matured and was formally promoted to a Project Analyst position, where I primarily champion collaboration with internal and client stakeholders to facilitate multi-departmental site acquisition problem solving.</p>

      <p>As noted by my direct supervisor, the Senior Vice President of Permitting, in my performance review: </p>

      <p> ‘[Shelby is] a key player in multidisciplinary team projects to design and implement more efficient processes to improve data accuracy and streamline our productivity.  Shelby has a great attitude towards work and is always looking for new challenges.  He has always shown solid commitment and a strong interest in growing in his career.’</p>
